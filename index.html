        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello there! I'm currently a master's student at the University of Central Lancashire. I'm a passionate gamer
            and a dedicated master's student trying to expand my knowledge and develop the skills needed to create games
            that people can enjoy and appreciate.</p>

        <p>Throughout university, I have been using C++. However, I have also used Dart and C# for other projects. I have used
            both Unreal Engine and Unity, with most of my experience being with Unreal. I enjoy AI in games, and for my third year
            project, I developed a small stealth game with AI using behavior trees in Unreal Engine.</p>

                <h3>Rogue Neo</h3>
                <p>Here we have my third-year project called Rogue Neo, it's a stealth game with a focus on AI
                    and behavior trees. The game is set in a world where the player is trying to steal data
                    from a corporation. The game is made in Unreal Engine 4 and uses C++ and Blueprints. Using behavior trees, I
                    was able to make AI that would be able to have hearing and vision senses, and the player would utilize their throwable
                    distractions and their surroundings to avoid being detected by the AI.</p>

                <h3>Movie Database App</h3>
                <p>This is another project I've worked on unrelated to games. A mobile application using Dart, where I used an 
                    API to get information about movies and display them in a list. The user can then click on the movie to get more
                    information and also add them to a watchlist. The app uses a local database to store the watchlist.</p>

            <!-- Project 3 description -->
            <div id="project3" class="project">
                <h3>Zyzz</h3>
                <p>Here is a game I made during the second year in a team setting. We used a Kanban approach to organize and set our targets.
                    The game was a 3D platformer made in Unreal Engine 4, where the player would play as a wizard navigating through levels
                    using parkour to get through the levels, collecting coins, and defeating dragons along the way. The game featured level traveling, 
                    a hub area, and multiple levels with different themes.</p>

            <!-- Project 4 description -->
            <div id="project4" class="project">
                <h3>Post Processing</h3>
                <p>In this project, I was introduced to post-processing effects. This involved rendering a scene to a texture instead of the
                    back buffer, creating effects, and then copying the textures to the backbuffer to show on the screen. This project involved
                    working with pixel shaders and vertex shaders using HLSL.</p>
