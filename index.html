        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello there! I'm currently a master's student at the University of Central Lancashire. I'm a passionate gamer
            and a dedicated master's student trying to expand my knowledge and develop the skills needed to create games
            that people can enjoy and appreciate.</p>

        <p>Throughout university, I have been using C++. However, I have also used Python, Dart and C# for other projects. I have used
            both Unreal Engine and Unity, with most of my experience being with Unreal. I enjoy AI in games, and for my third year
            project, I developed a small stealth game with AI using behavior trees in Unreal Engine.</p>

                <h3>Rogue Neo</h3>
                <p>Here we have my third-year project called Rogue Neo, it's a stealth game with a strong focus on AI
                    and behavior trees. The game is set in a world where the player is trying to steal data
                    from a corporation. The game is made in Unreal Engine 4 and uses C++ and Blueprints. The AI enemy possess
                    hearing and vision senses making it crucial for players to be aware of their surroundings and plan accordingly.
                    The player was able to use distractions to create openings in order to help them create different strategies, 
                    and multiple hiding objects were placed around the level in order to keep the player hidden, the stealth design was
                    incorporated to challenge the player, and give the game a sense of unpredictability. Rogue Neo was my one of my favourite 
                    ambitious projects that allowed me to gain knowledge on multiple areas of game development such as AI programming, level design, user testing
                    and balancing. </p>

                <h3>Movie Database App</h3>
                <p>This is another project I've worked on unrelated to games. A mobile application using Dart, where I used an 
                    API to retrieve and display movie/tv show information in a user friendly list. By utilising the TMDB API, the app was able to dynamically
                    fetch movie information that was kept up to date. The user can then click on the movie to get more
                    information and also add them to a watchlist. The app featured SQLite, which is a lightweight adn efficient database that stores information
                    locally, this was used to store the watchlist which enchanced the practicality of the application. The app also featured a search function and a sort function
                    which allowed users to search for movies but also allow users to sort movies by popularity and alphabetically. This was done by using the API to fetch the data
                    of the application giving it more use. Error handling was also added where appropriate to ensure that the app would funVtion correctly with 
                    even if there were problems with the API.

                <h3>Zyzz</h3>
                <p>Here is a game I made during my second year of university in a team setting. We used a Kanban approach to organize and set our targets, 
                    by using this approach our tasks were able to be tracked and monitored by other members and we were able to set ourselves appropriate 
                    deadlines to meet.
                    The game was a 3D platformer made in Unreal Engine 4 using Blueprints and some C++, we went for a blueprint approach to familiarise ourselves
                    with Unreal Engine's features, which would help in future projects where we would be able to determine where to use blueprints when appropriate, 
                    where the player would play as a wizard navigating through levels
                    using parkour i.e., double jump and wall jumping, to get through the levels, collecting coins, and defeat dragons along the way. 
                    The game featured level traveling, a hub area, a combat system that was able to track damage and change the values accordingly 
                    and multiple levels with different themes.
                    Zyzz was one of the first projects where i worked in a team and organised the team's deadlines and timetable to meet deadlines,
                    on top of developing my parts of zyzz, which was the tutorial level, level traveling system, hub world and combat system. I was also
                    updating the Kanban, communicating with the team ensuring that deadline would be met, altering the deadlines when necessary, consulting with
                    the team when changes were to be made and assisting the team when it came to challenging features. </p>

            <div id="project4" class="project">
                <h3>Post Processing</h3>
                <p>In this project, I was introduced to post-processing effects. This involved rendering a scene to a texture instead of the
                    back buffer, creating effects, and then copying the textures to the backbuffer to show on the screen. In simpler terms,
                    post-processing is used to change the scene in order to reach a desired effect utilising the GPU, similar to adding filters to a photo. 
                    This project involved, setting up a 3D scene, working with pixel shaders and vertex shaders to manipulate the pixel colours to achieve a specific 
                    effect using DirectX. I had implemented 7 effects, and also implemented area post processing, which enabled the effects in a specific area, in this case 
                    a window.</p>
                    <p>The following are the 7 effects implemented:</p>
                    <p>Colour Tint - vertical colour gradient</p>
                    <p>Standard Blur - a basic blur effect </p>
                    <p>Underwater - colour tint paired with distortion to create an effect similar to being underwater </p>
                    <p>Gaussian blur - uses an algorithm and uses 2 pixel shaders one blurring vertically and the other horizontally to create a nicer natural blur</p>
                    <p>Bloom - Increases the lighting from the light source to generate a brighter scene</p>
                    <p>Hue gradient - a colour gradient that changes colour over time using the HSL colour space (Hue, Saturation, Luminance) </p>
                    <p>Retro - My personal favourite, Limits the colour palette and increases the size of the pixels to create a Retro game style effect</p>

                    <p>***FLASH WARNING IN VIDEO 1:10 - 1:22***</p>
                    <p>due to the colour gradient transition being coded to change per frame the gradient transition did 
                        not come up as a smooth transition in the video.</p>

                            <h3>Melanoma Detection</h3>
                            <p>Here is a piece of work that I was quite proud of, an AI system that was able to predict whether or not a picture of 
                                potential Melanoma was cancerous or not. The model,developed in Python was trained with the largest public database of melanoma images,
                                The ISIC Database, this was a big challenge having little to no knowledge in actual AI, so alot of research was done to find an appropriate
                                AI model that was lightweight, efficent and accurate. I opted to use the MobileNetV2 model, which was a model designed to perform well on mobile
                                devices. The model was a pretrained model that was made for images making it perfect for this project. The model was trained using 
                                the ISIC training data and was tested using the ISIC testing data. The model was able to achieve an accuracy of 93.7% which was a great achievement.
                                The model was then shown images that I had found that were not included in the ISIC database, and the model was able to predict whether or not the image
                                was cancerous or not. I also included a probability value to show confident the model was with its prediction, a value close to 0.01 meant the image
                                was most likely not cancerous, a value close to 0.99 meant the image was most likely cancerous and a value close to 0.5 meant the model was unsure.
