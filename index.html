        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hello there! I'm currently a masters student in the University of Central Lancashire, I'm a passionate gamer
            and a dedicated masters student trying to expand my knowledge and develop the skills needed to create games
            that people can enjoy and appreciate. </p>

        <p> Throughout university I have been using C++, however I have also used Dart and C# for other projects. I have used
            both Unreal Engine and Unity with most my experience being with Unreal., I enjoy AI in games and for my third year
            project I developed a small stealth game with AI using behaviour trees in Unreal Engine</p>

            <h3>Rogue Neo</h3>
            <p>Here we have my third year project called Rogue Neo, it's a stealth game with a focus on AI
                and behaviour trees. The game is set in a world where the player is trying to steal data
                from a corporation. The game is made in Unreal Engine 4 and uses C++ and Blueprints. Using behaviour trees I
                was able to make AI that would be able to have hearing and vision senses, the player would utilise their throwable
                distractions and their surroundings to avoid being detected by the AI. </p>

            <h3>Movie database app</h3>
            <p>This is another project I've worked on unrelated to games. A mobile application using Dart, here i used an 
                api to get information about movies and display them in a list. The user can then click on the movie to get more
                information and also add them to a watchlist. The app uses a local database to store the watchlist. </p>

            <h3>Zyzz</h3>
            <p>Here is a game I made during second year in a team setting, we used a kanban approach to organise and set our targets.
                The game was a 3d platformer made in unreal engine 4, where the player would play as a wizard navigating through levels
                using parkour to get through the levels, collecting coins and defeating dragons along the way. The game featured level travelling, 
                a hub area, and multiple levels with different themes. </p>

            <h3>Post Processing</h3>
            <p> In this project I was introduced to post processing effect, this involved rendering a scene to a texture instead of the
                back buffer, creating effects then copying the textures to the backbuffer to show on the screen. This project involved
                working with pixel shaders and vertex shaders using HLSL.  </p>
