        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hello there! I'm currently a masters student in the University of Central Lancashire, I'm a passionate gamer
            and a dedicated masters student trying to expand my knowledge and develop the skills needed to create games
            that people can enjoy and appreciate. </p>

        <p> Throughout university I have been using C++, however I have also used Dart and C# for other projects. I have used
            both Unreal Engine and Unity with most my experience being with Unreal., I enjoy AI in games and for my third year
            project I developed a small stealth game with AI using behaviour trees in Unreal Engine</p>

            <h3>Rogue Neo</h3>
            <p>Here we have my third year project called Rogue Neo, it's a stealth game with a focus on AI
                and behaviour trees. The game is set in a world where the player is trying to steal data
                from a corporation. The game is made in Unreal Engine 4 and uses C++ and Blueprints. Using behaviour trees I
                was able to make AI that would be able to have hearing and vision senses, the player would utilise their throwable
                distractions and their surroundings to avoid being detected by the AI. </p>
